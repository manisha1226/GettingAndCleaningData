# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository contains my assignment files for the final assignment of the Getting and Cleaning data course

## The repository contains the following files.

1. README.md - That is ofcourse this file, that describes everything!
2. run_analysis.r - The R script that reads the files, merges, renames and performs calculation necessary to calculate the means of all the variable by the activity and subject.
        > This is the only script file I have created, and what you need to run to get the output file.
        > It assumes that all files have been downloaded and saved to the project working directory
        > It creates the TidyData.txt output file that has the final output data
        > I have included appropriate comments in the r script file to describe how I have approached and solved the problem.
        
3. CodeBook.md - This file describes the data int the final TidyData.txt file. It lists all the columns, their classes, and their contents.I have created it as a .md file, so please try to view it as a .html, or .doc, it looks prettier like that.

## The repository DOES NOT contains the following files.

1. TidyData.txt. - I was supposed to upload that separately

## Thank you for reviewing and grading my assignment!! You are the best!!
